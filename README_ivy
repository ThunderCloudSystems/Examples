This file contains notes regarding the use of ivy in the book projects:

Ivy re-resolve: Ivy keeps a cache of jar files that can sometimes become
stale and that can create compile errors in the projects that use ivy -
such as ClassNotFoundExceptions related to the JPA API, mainly the service
oriented examples. The solution to this problems is to "re-resolve" the
ivy dependencies in Eclipse. You can perform this task as follows:

1. Right mouse click the open project in Eclipse

2. Then select Ivy -> Resolve
