This file contains help for converting UNIX specific project instructions to
their windows equivalent.

Many chapters in the book rely on the use of the cygwin UNIX system for
windows, you should follow the instructions for installing that toolchain in chapter 6.

If you plan to execute commands in windows cmd, you will need to replace all '/' 
characters in directory paths  with '\'

Make sure to use .bat equivalents of scripts, as in the case of
%CATALINA_HOME%/bin/startup.bat

For many examples, especially chapter 12, you will need to use cygwin - the
required utilities just dont exist on windows.

Make sure to set the following system environment variables:

JAVA_HOME
ANT_HOME
CATALINA_HOME

Place the following directories into the system path variable:

%JAVA_HOME%\bin
%ANT_HOME%\bin
%CATALINA_HOME%\bin
