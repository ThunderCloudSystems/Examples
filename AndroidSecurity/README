This is sample code for Chapter 12 of Wiley's Enterprise Android. This code
provides several discrete examples that demonstrate security techniques
for the Android platform and its use with backend services.

The samples include:

Protecting data: uses AES256 to encrypt data in a file.

Protecting passwords: Uses a secure hashing system to protect passwords.

Protecting communication: involves setting up an HTTPS exported version
of the chapter 6 service, and a then executing a secure invocation to it from
an Android client that uses basic authentication.

Using Accounts: An example that provides a basic demonstrations of
how to use the Android Account Manager.

----------

The code includes an application UI called, AndroidSecurity, that allows you
to execute each of these examples. Run, "ant eclipse" and then you can
open the project folder in Eclipse.

Note: The example "Protecting Communication" includes an additional set of
tasks that you must follow before you can use the AndroidSecurity UI
to run it. You can find these instructions in the chapter text, and in the
project file:
