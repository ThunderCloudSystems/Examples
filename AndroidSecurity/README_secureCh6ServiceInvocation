This is sample code for Chapter 12 of Wiley's Enterprise Android. This code
provides an example for invoking a secure connection on a secure version of
the chapter 6 service.

Securing the Chapter6 Contacts Service:
--------------------

1. Securing the chapter 6 contacts web service:
    a. Creating a “Certificate Signing Request”
    b. Creating your own CA
    c. Obtaining a site certificate for service authentication.
    d. Configuring an HTTPS transport for Tomcat: with JSSE or APR
    e. Authenticating the service using basic authentication.

2. Invoking a secure connection on Android and sending client credentials  to
   the service using basic authentication.

1. Securing the chapter 6 contacts service
----------

    a. Creating a “Certificate Signing Request”
       The following steps for creating a signing request are based on the
       OpenSSL tool, which is pre-installed on Linux and Mac OS:

        1. If you are using Windows, install cygwin software from the following
           location:

           http://www.cygwin.com/install.html

           a. After launching the cygwin setup, select a host to install from,
              and then check the following packages for installation:

              * Net/OpenSSH
              * Net/OpenSSL
              * Perl/Larry Wall’s Wait Practical Extraction and Report Language

            b. Wait until cygwin completes its install (a fast connection takes
               5-10 minutes).

        2. Start a shell on your particular platform. On Windows, double-click
           Cygwin-Terminal. The example assumes that the SSL software is located
           at:

           OPENSSL=/usr/bin/openssl

        3. Create a CA working directory and change directory to it. These
           instructions refer to it as CA_DIR.

           cd $(CA_DIR)

           Run all commands from this directory.

        4. Create a private key as follows:

           $(OPENSSL)/openssl genrsa -out contacts_privkey.pem 1024

        5. Create a certificate as follows:

           $(OPENSSL)/openssl req -new -x509 -key contacts_privkey.pem -out contacts_cert.pem

           Answer the questions.

           Note that when you generate the certificate, the "common name"
           should be the exact fully qualified hostname of the contacts service
           site - will be accessed from the Android client.

           Please keep in mind that the FQDN you choose for your site must be
           an actual resolvable DNS hostname from whatever Android environment
           you use – the Android emulator or an Android device. It’s a good
           idea to load the site name as a web page in the Android browser
           to make certain Android can really see it. Note also, that the DNS
           name must not use a known root domain like amazonaws.com, but must
           be your own domain.

         6. Create a “request to sign” the certificate, by concatenating the
            certificate from Step 5 with the private key from Step 4, as
            follows:

            cat contacts_cert.pem contacts_privkey.pem | $(OPENSSL)/openssl x509 -x509toreq -signkey contacts_privkey.pem -out contacts_certreq.csr

            Now that you have a signing request, you can choose to do one of
            two things with it:

            * Pay a fee to have a commercial certificate authority, such as
              VeriSign or StartSSL to sign it. This service varies widely in
              price, but start at about $150 for a two year certificate.
            * Create your own certificate authority, recognized by all the
              applications that you write, and sign the certificate yourself.

    b. Creating Your Own CA

       As previously discussed, a service needs a certificate for secure
       handshakes with clients. It turns out that with mobile applications it’s
       entirely possible to become your own certificate authority and avoid any
       hassle associated with buying certificates. You can create as many of
       your own free and valid certificates as you need. If you want to become
       your own certificate authority (optional), run the following utilities,
       as per your platform:

       1. Create a new CA:
          Linux:
          /usr/lib/ssl/misc/CA.pl –newca

          Mac OS:
          /System/Library/OpenSSL/misc/CA.pl -newca

          Cygwin:
          perl /usr/ssl/misc/CA.pl –newca

          Press the enter to create.

       2. As you run the CA.pl program, answer the questions as follows:
          a. Press enter when the tool asks for the CA certificate filename.
          b. Enter a PEM passphrase
          c. Pick values for locality and organization:

          d. The common name is the name of your certificate authority; choose
             an appropriate name (e.g. "my root CA").

          e. Choose passphrases as appropriate.
          f. Enter your email.
          g. Enter a challenge password; you'll use this password when you sign
             certificates.

             When the program completes, you should have the files you need
             to act as your own CA. Your CA certificate should now reside in
             demoCA/cacert.pem, and you can start signing certificates with it.

             Note that the default expiration period of certificates that you
             sign with your CA is 365 days, as specified in the CA.pl script.
             If you need to make the period longer, you’ll need to modify
             CA.pl to change the duration.
           h. Enter the passphrase from 1,b,2,b.

    c. Obtaining a site certificate

       If you create your own CA, now sign the sign the certificate request
       from Step 1,a,6 of “Create a certificate signing request” with the files
       generated in demoCA. Run the following command from the output, demoCA
       directory from “Creating your own CA”:

        $(OPENSSL)\openssl ca -policy policy_anything -in contacts_certreq.csr -out contactservice.pem

        1. Enter the passphrase that you entered from 1,b,2,b and sign and commit
           the new certificate. Note that you can only sign the same cert
           request one time.
        2. Make sure that the size of contactservice.pem is not zero – this
           file contains your new certificate.
        3. You can now add contactservice.pem to web service back-ends to
           communicate using HTTPS with Android applications. You will add
           $(CA_DIR)/demoCA/cacert.pem to the root store of your Android
           client, which is explained shortly.

    If you did not create your own CA, from this point, use your
    commercially obtained certificate.

    d. Setting Up Tomcat for Secure Transport

        Now that you have a certificate, you can configure your instance of
        Tomcat to use it. You'll export the contacts service with an HTTPS
        transport. You can configure Tomcat to use your certificates in two
        ways:

        * Using Java Secure Sockets (JSSE), generally used with production
          deployments.
        * Using a native technology called the Apache Portable Runtime, which
          is generally used in development deployments.

        1. Configuring Tomcat using JSSE

             a. Create a service keystore and import the contact private key
                and service certificate into it.

                Tomcat will use the keystore to support HTTPs with the contacts
                service. Server-side Java supports the keystore file format
                “JKS” for storing certificates and a utility for editing it
                called keytool.

                Convert the private key:

                openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -in  contacts_privkey.pem -inform PEM -out contacts_privkey.der -outform DER

                Convert the signed certificate:

                openssl x509 -in contactservice.pem -inform PEM -out contactservice.der -outform DER

                Its common to use keytool to edit Java key stores, but in this
                case, you will need to use a Java utility to import the
                converted certificate files into the keystore. You can
                download it from the following location:

                http://www.agentbob.info/agentbob/80/version/default/part/AttachmentData/data/ImportKey.java

                Or you can use the version included in:

                $(CODE)/AndroidSecurity/ImportKey.java

                Edit the file to set your keystore password – change the
                variable, keypass.

                Compile this utility using:
                javac –d . $(CODE)/AndroidSecurity/ImportKey.java

                Run ImportKey to create the keystore and import the private key
                and contacts certificate, as follows:

                java -Dkeystore=<cadir>/tomcat_keystore.jks ImportKey <cadir>/contacts_privkey.der <cadir>/contactservice.der

                You should be able to list the contents of the keystore using:

                keytool -list -v -keystore tomcat_keystore.jks

              b. Edit the Tomcat server configuration file, called
                 $(TOMCAT_HOME)/conf/server.xml, by uncommenting the 8443 ssl
                 connector to make it active. Edit the fields to match the
                 following code:

              <Connector port="8443" maxThreads="200"
                  scheme="https" secure="true" SSLEnabled="true"
                  keystoreFile="<ca_dir>/tomcat_keystore.jks" keystorePass="<your_password>"
                  clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS"/>

              c. Enter the password from Step 1,b,2,b of “Creating Your Own
                 Root CA” or the password you used for your commercial
                 certificate. Change ca_dir to be the directory where your CA
                 authenticated private key resides.

              d. Restart Tomcat.


        2. Configuring Tomcat Using APR

           APR is significantly easier to configure than JSSE. You can just
           use the certificates you have created by directly configuring them
           into the Tomcat configuration file, $(TOMCAT)/conf/server.xml, as
           follows:

           <-- Define a SSL Coyote HTTP/1.1 Connector on port 8443 -->
           <Connector
               port="8443" maxThreads="200"
               scheme="https" secure="true" SSLEnabled="true"
               SSLCertificateFile="<ca_dir>/contactservice.pem"
               SSLCertificateKeyFile="/usr/local/ssl/contacts_privkey.pem"
               clientAuth="optional" SSLProtocol="TLSv1"
           />

Opening a secure connection on Android
----------

1. Enter the hostname from step 1,a,5 into the following field:

$(CODE)/AndroidSecurity/src/com/enterpriseandroid/androidSecurity/SecureConnectionActivity.javaSecureConnectionActivity.SECURE_HOST

Set the secure port, likely 443 or 8443, as needed into:

$(CODE)/AndroidSecurity/src/com/enterpriseandroid/androidSecurity/HttpsClientHelper.SECURE_PORT

2. If you used your own CA, you'll need to download the following useful
graphical tool, called portecle, for this task:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/portecle/

Unzip the download file and then run portecle using the following command
line from the unzipped directory:

java –jar <unzip_dir>/portecle.jar

Import your CA certificate,

 <cadir>/demoCA/cacert.pem

into a new keystore, which should be of type BKS,
and save it into the following directory with the name listed below:

$(CODE)/AndroidSecurity/res/raw/your_ownca_keystore.bks

Run the Android Security Application and choose the Secure connection
option.
