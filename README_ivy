This file contains notes regarding the use of ivy in the book projects:

Ivy re-resolve: Ivy keeps a cache of jar files which can sometimes become
stale and which can create compile errors in the projects that use ivy -
such as ClassNotFoundExceptions related to 
mainly the service oriented examples. The solution to this problem is to
"re-resolve" the ivy dependencies in Eclipse. You can perform this task
as follows:

1. Right mouse click the open project in Eclipse

2. Then select Ivy -> Resolve
