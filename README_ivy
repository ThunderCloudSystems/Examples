This file contains notes regarding the use of ivy in the book projects:

Ivy re-resolve: Ivy keeps a cache of jar files that can sometimes become
stale and that can create compile errors in the projects that use ivy,
like the service oriented examples. Problems often show up as
ClassNotFoundException related to the JPA API.

The solution to this issue is to "re-resolve" the ivy dependencies in 
Eclipse. You can perform this task as follows:

1. Right mouse click the open project in Eclipse

2. Then select Ivy -> Resolve
