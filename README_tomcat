To debug problems with Tomcat, view the contents of the file:

$CATALINA_HOME/logs/catalina.out

or the log file named with the current date.  Aside from simply running the
'cat' command in a shell, you can also have the contents printed live to a
console in a shell using the tail command as follows:

tail $CATALINA_HOME/logs/catalina.out
